# Java Producer-Consumer with Spring Boot

Producer Consumer Problem is a typical multi-process synchronization problem where both
processes are sharing the shared fixed-size buffer also referred to as the queue.

This is a Producer-Consumer implmentation in Spring boot where one or more Producers is generating a series of tasks and one or more Consumers
are consuming the generated tasks for processing. 

Both Consumers & Producers have a shared place (Queue) where the Producer adds tasks and the Consumer removes and processes the tasks.
